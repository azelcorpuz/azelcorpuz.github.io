I am Azel and I am a developer and I love to know how things works!

I have experienced with `Java` and `Big Data Technologies`. I also tried `C# DotNet Core` development and still trying :)

I am working on my `frontend skills` - `vue` and `Angular` - but its not really my thing :D *(its hard to be an OCD person if you are working on `frontend` :P)*

I am trying to understand `Go` and as well as `NodeJS` - but I am not sure yet when can get my hands dirty with it :)

Development is not my one and only interest - I also `design applications` and has experience with `DevOps`.

I know how to configure and use some tools like `Jenkins`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes` and `Gitlab CI` - I design `Software Factory` too! I tried once `AWS` but i just managed to configure and use an `EC2` service :P - more to go with the cloud computing I guess.

I am not sure where to go - I like to be a `data scientist` with my little experience with big data but I also want to be a `solution architect` - maybe you'll be updated once i decided.

But for now, let me know how can i help your business! :)
