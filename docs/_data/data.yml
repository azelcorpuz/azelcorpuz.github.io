    title: Career Summary
    summary: |
      Last year, the first application that I designed myself (but of course, with the help of other people 
      and my team) went to production on time and it is one of the greatest achievement 
      I had and this is the kind of success I would like to have in the next few years of my career. 
      <i>This is all because of the 8 years of experience that I had and its all worth it.</i>

      <i>My strength is software development, and I love what I’m doing.</i> I like to try new technologies 
      and analyse what and where is the problem and fix it. <i>Java</i> is my expertise but I’ve also 
      gathered different technology skillset and you’ll find it below. The best non-Java I did is when 
      I designed and implemented our <i>software factory</i> because once its done, delivering software 
      is just a piece of cake and I appreciate it everyday.
      
      Lastly, <i>I am what I am now is also because of the people I’ve worked with.</i> I have worked with 
      many different teams with different races in 2 different countries, I worked in France for few months 
      and all of them contributed with all the knowledge I’ve gained. I like discussing with technical leads, 
      architects and developers and honestly, that’s how I learned.
