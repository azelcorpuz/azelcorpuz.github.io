## Homebrew Installation
1. Go to desired directory where to install homebrew
1. I've used untar anywhere installation option, by running this, it downloads the homebrew tar and untar it to the target directory `homebrew`:
```
mkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
```
2. Add the following to the environment variable - if using ZSH, add it to `~/.zshenv`
```
export HOMEBREW_HOME=<YOUR_DESIRED_DIR>/homebrew
export PATH=$HOMEBREW_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
3. do reload the environment variables, if using ZSH, run the following:
```
source ~/.zshenv
```

4. run `brew config` and check the following:
```
HOMEBREW_PREFIX: <YOUR_DESIRED_DIR>/homebrew
HOMEBREW_CELLAR: <YOUR_DESIRED_DIR>/homebrew/Cellar
```
*these configs were automatically set  - i didn't do anything - maybe because of the installation i used? Others might find it in `/usr/local/`*
* `prefix` - is where the symlink will be created, it add `/bin` automatically
* `cellar` - is where the binaries will be located:

## Tools installed via homebrew
1. GIT - i have git installed in `/usr/bin/` but because of SIP, i cannot update GIT to newest version. I let it but i also installed it via `homebrew`, i just make sure that `HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin` comes first befor the `/usr/bin/` in the `PATH` so that it will take the `git` installed by homebrew
