## Homebrew Installation
1. Go to desired directory where to install homebrew
1. I've used untar anywhere installation option, by running this, it downloads the homebrew tar and untar it to the target directory `homebrew`:
```
mkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
```
2. Add the following to the environment variable - if using ZSH, add it to `~/.zshenv`
```
export HOMEBREW_HOME=<YOUR_DESIRED_DIR>/homebrew
export PATH=$PATH:$HOMEBREW_HOME/bin
```
3. do reload the environment variables, if using ZSH, run the following:
```
source ~/.zshenv
```
